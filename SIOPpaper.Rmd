  Now we are evaluating the psychometric properties of the dirty dozen simplified Chinese version by using samples in real settings: job applicants and incumbents (in addition to students). We replicate a previous study using the student sample, then continue to evaluate with organizational data. We find that the scales are non-invariant. Seems to be revisiting these articles: @geng2015dirty and @grigoras2020measurement

Initially we were interested in looking at reliance on student samples. Now we are evaluating the psychometric properties of the dirty dozen (DD) simplified Chinese version by using samples in real settings: job applicants and incumbents (in addition to students). We replicate a previous study using the student sample (Yang gonna send some articles), then continue to evaluate with organizational data. We find that the scales are non-invariant. 

SDSME another version (27 items).

All studies investigating psychometric properties of these scales use University students. 

Some groups may be expected to exhibit different item-construct associations due to shifting motivational forces. 

ITC guidlines for translating and adapting tests recommends looking at possible differences across motives [@itc_2017]. For example,

# Methods

We follow the We also look at intercorrelations among items within the samplings. 

```{r readingdata}

library(foreign)
library(careless)

## A30-A41 are Dirty Dozen
## A42-A57 are Hexico Honesty-Humility
## within the HH scale there are subscales (identified in "67624 research items update.xlsx)

masterdata <- read.spss("Dirty Dozon data for SIOP.sav")
tempdata <- data.frame(masterdata)                           ## Yang other variables
DDdata <- data.frame(masterdata[c(1:3,34:45)])

table <- descr::freq(DDdata$selection, plot=FALSE)
dtable <- cbind(sample = rownames(table), table) ## to call out in paper


####################################### data screening below

careless_long <- longstring(DDdata[4:15])
careless_irv <- irv(DDdata[4:15])

careless_long <- data.frame(careless_long)
careless_irv  <- data.frame(careless_irv)

DDdata <- cbind(DDdata, careless_long, careless_irv)

#descr::freq(DDdata$careless_long)
#descr::freq(DDdata$careless_irv)

use <- DDdata[ which(DDdata$careless_long<7), ]


```

## Participants

In total `r nrow(DDdata)` individuals responded to the Dirty Dozen (as well as additional scales not the focus of the current presentation). This total was comprised of `r dtable[1,2]` `r dtable[1,1]`, `r dtable[2,2]` `r dtable[2,1]`, and `r dtable[3,2]` `r dtable[3,1]` individuals. After screening for undifferentiated responses via the `R` package `careless` [@R-careless], we retained `r nrow(use)` respondents who had no more than 6 sequentially identical responses across the 12 total items.

## Material

## Procedure

Decrease in $\Delta\chi^2$ across models indicates a lack of invariance (typically not considered a "good thing"). Multiple indices are consulted across models, including $\Delta\chi^2$, RMSEA, CFI, TLI, BIC, and AIC. 

Also want to look at correlations of the simplified Chinese version of the DD with the Honesty-Humility subscales (Sincerity, Fairness, Greed Avoidance, and Modesty).

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses. 

```{r figure1, fig.cap="Steps for measurement invariance (taken from Xu, 2012)."}

knitr::include_graphics("steps.PNG")

```

# Results

We looked at structural invariance as well as latent means [@steinmetz2009testing; @meredith1993measurement]. The models failed to exhibit metric invariance (Model 2 - Model 1 exhibited a significant $\Delta$ on both $\chi^2$ as well as RMSEA) 

> Not sure how to pull table or identify object elements - `model1` object is too large to navigate easily.

Yang also wanted correlations

```{r scalecors}

library(corx)

x <- corx(tempdata[,74:81],
          triangle = "lower",
          stars = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001),
          describe = c(`$M$` = mean, `$SD$` = sd))

papaja::apa_table(x$apa, # apa contains the data.frame needed for apa_table
                  caption = "Scale intercorrelations (all participants).",
                  note = "* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001",
                  escape = F)
